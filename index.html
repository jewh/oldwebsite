        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I'm a 23 year-old DPhil student at the University of Oxford.
            Prior to commencing my graduate studies I studied for a BSc (Hons)
            in Biology and Mathematics at the University of St Andrews. 
            I grew up in Moray, Scotland.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of my studies I spend a lot of my free time looking for moths (Lepidoptera).
            As such, some of the pages on this site might be dedicated to moth-related topics.

    <h2>Research</h2>

    <p>
        Broadly I am interested in the way the morphology of multicellular
        organisms develops, and the theoretical principles of this and how
        they alter which morphologies may be realised through evolution.
    </p>

    <p>
        For my DPhil project I am studying the process of somitogenesis,
        an elegant process that occurs in the early vertebrate embryo, sequentially dividing
        the trunk body into segments. Within the teleost fish (Teleostei), the number of segments
        is highly variable across species, and my project is examining the role
        of somitogenesis in generating this high degree of evolvability. I am using a combination of 
        experimental and computational techniques to investigate this.
